# Clean Copy

I saw a cool [tip](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus/status/425714449774030848) from
[@sindresorhus](https://twitter.com/sindresorhus) on Twitter:

> OS X tip: `pbpaste | pbcopy` to remove text formatting from something you copied.

Because @beckyjoy had just asked me for advice on how to remove formatting after copying it out of a document, I figured it'd be nice to package the script as an OS X application (using Automator.app) for folks who aren't Terminal-savvy.

So go download the [latest release](https://github.com/searls/clean-copy/releases/latest)!
